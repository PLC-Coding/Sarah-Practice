							<h2>About Me<br />	</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I am a passionate and results-driven Instructional Designer with a deep commitment to creating engaging, student-centered learning experiences in a collegiate setting. With a background in education and extensive experience in curriculum design, I specialize in developing innovative, evidence-based courses that meet both academic and institutional goals.

							<p></p>My approach combines a strong understanding of pedagogy with the latest technologies and best practices in e-learning. I collaborate closely with faculty and subject matter experts to craft courses that are not only academically rigorous but also accessible and interactive. Whether I am developing fully online courses, blended learning modules, or traditional face-to-face lessons, my focus is always on promoting active learning, critical thinking, and student success.
							
							<p></p>I leverage learning management systems (LMS) like Canvas or Moodle to create intuitive, easy-to-navigate course environments. Additionally, I integrate multimedia tools, formative assessments, and learner analytics to ensure that students receive immediate, meaningful feedback and support throughout their academic journey.
							
							<p></p>I am driven by a belief that education should be transformative and inclusive, and I am dedicated to using my skills to enhance the learning experience, foster academic growth, and contribute to the overall success of the institution. As an instructional designer, I am always seeking to innovate and stay ahead of trends in the field to ensure my courses meet the evolving needs of both students and educators.</p>

							<h3>Synthesia Video</h3>
							<p>This video was created for an introduction to a course. As a form of continuous improvement to the Constuction program, videos like this one were created to guides learners on how to inially navigate the course. </p>

							<h3>Storyline: Types of Networks</h3>
							<p>This drag and drop activity is used in a course about the different types of Networks. When the students place the item in the correct location, the item highlights green and red if it is incorrect. This activity needed to be recreated from scratch based on the description for instructor, this is how I approached the project to show the levels and how they build out to larger networks. </p>

							<h3>Rise: Recordkeeping and Reporting</h3>
							<p>This lesson was created using Rise 360 for an OSHA course. It is based off of the PowerPoint notes and replaces the PowerPoint for students to interact with the content. Inside of this Rise lesson, there is also a Storyline and a variety of blocks for students to interact and learn the content. </p>

							<h3>HackMe Higher Ed</h3>
							<p>Storyline: This is a branching scenario where students have to navigate around and find the passwords in order to complete the activity. The initial idea was an interactive activity for students to find some passwords they will need for a future lab activity in the course. Once students find a password, they record it and then they must find the others for a total of three in order to move on to the lab. </p>

							<h3>Create a DMZ</h3>
							<p>Storyline: This activity is a drag and drop which uses multiple correct drop zones and it highlights correct if the item is placed in a correct drop location. This idea for multiple correct drops was from the instructor since the order didn't matter but the locations did matter.</p>

							<h3>Compare and Contrast Security Controls</h3>
							<p>Rise: This is an Articulate Rise lesson where I collaborated with the instructor in order to create the lesson. The instructor gave me notes and some images to use, and in turn I helped place the information into blocks. </p>

						<div class="testimonial">
						  <p class="quote">"It has been such a rewarding experience to work with Sarah these last few years as Instructional Designers for TSTC.  We both began in the Spring of 2021 with a growing team of talented individuals.  My first experience of collaborating with Sarah was on a specific project for a Canvas course geared towards course design.  We worked with a few other IDs on this project, but I had the opportunity to see Sarah’s work ethic, drive, initiative, and collaborative spirit shine.  I knew I wanted to have more collaborative opportunities with her from then on.   We have continued to do various projects together and it never feels like work.  Sarah is also very helpful to other IDs on our team, consistently offering a helping hand when needed.  She is an amazing asset to our team and the programs she diligently oversees.   I am incredibly grateful for our work relationship, but also our friendship we have built and continue to build. "</p>
